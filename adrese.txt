You can get the (R)ecovery (I)s (P)ossible Linux rescue system here!

It's a regular ISO! Make sure the program you use to download it
understands it's a binary file. If it's downloaded as a text file
it could get corrupted and be unusable.

You'll need at least 256MB of RAM and a 586 CPU
to boot and use it!
